# Welcome to the BNS Hub

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the BNS Hub, a central platform for announcements and documentation related to the Bitcoin Name System (BNS).

BNS is a community-led protocol that aims to enable the registration of human-readable names on the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchain. With BNS, individuals can create a unique, censorship-resistant name.

The BNS Hub has been created to serve as a central repository for all things related to BNS. Here, you can find the latest news, updates, and announcements related to the protocol. We also aim to provide detailed documentation to help users better understand how BNS works and how to get started using it.

We hope that by creating a central platform for all things BNS, we can help foster a stronger community around the protocol and encourage more widespread adoption.

We invite everyone in the BNS community to explore the hub and share their feedback with us. The whole site is open-source, and we encourage contributions. We're committed to continually improving BNS as a whole and making sure it grows in the right direction.

Thanks for checking it out!
