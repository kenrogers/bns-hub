# BNSx Protocol

BNSx is a protocol that extends and improves upon BNS, the Bitcoin Name System built on the Stacks Bitcoin layer. With BNS users can register a globally unique name with ownership hashed to the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Why BNSx?

At launch, BNSx will provide solutions for specific BNS shortcomings:

- **SIP9 compatibility**: SIP9 is the Stacks blockchain's standard for NFT assets. By adopting SIP9 compatibility, BNSx names are automatically usable in any marketplace, wallet, and app that supports Stacks NFTs.
- **Multiple names per address**: by allowing a single address to own more than one name, BNSx improves the user experience, but it also opens up the possibility for smart contracts to control names in innovative ways.

Long term, BNSx can act as platform adding features, flexibility, and composability to BNS. Hopefully these new features are valuable and BNSx can eventually become the "official next version" of BNS.

Here's an overview of the differences between BNS and BNSx:
