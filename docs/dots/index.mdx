## Dots FAQ

### Why should I use the Dots app?

Dots is an app for all things BNS names. The app launched along with [BNSx](./bnsx/intro) to allow users to migrate names between BNS and BNSx. Since then, we've added a bunch of other features to make managing your names easier.

### Does the Dots app or BNSx contract collect any fees?

No.

### Will Dots offer batch operations tools for upgrading?

Yes - check out the docs for [managing multiple accounts](./dots/migrate-multiple-accounts).
